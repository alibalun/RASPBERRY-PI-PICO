>_1-) If distance between 2 - 10 red led lights up and buzzer noise continously._<br/>
>_2-) If distance between 10 - 20, yellow led lights up, buzzer noise for 250ms and after buzzer stops 250ms.(Continues like this until change distance)_<br/>
>_3-) If distance between 20 - 30 green led light up, buzzer noise for 500ms and after buzzer stops 500ms.(Continues like this until change distance)_<br/>
